# 👋 Hey, I'm Dağlar Efe

I'm a **Computer Science student** who enjoys building things on the web — clean, fast, and functional.  
I like solving problems, learning new tools, and turning ideas into something that actually works.

---

### 💻 What I Do
- Build **web apps** using **Node.js, Express, and Next.js**  
- Design simple and clear **user interfaces** with **Tailwind CSS**  
- Work with **MariaDB + Prisma** for structured, maintainable databases  
- Explore **WebRTC, real-time systems,** and AI-assisted development  

I care about writing readable code, keeping projects modular, and making things that feel effortless to use.

### 🌐 My Website
🖥️ [daglarefe.com](https://daglarefe.com)  
A minimalist personal site — dark, quiet, and simple.  
Nothing fancy, just a space that reflects who I am.

---

### 🧠 Mindset
I like systems that make sense, and designs that don’t try too hard.  
Less noise, more clarity.  
> “Make it simple, but significant.”
